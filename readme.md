# docker_srcds
Run a source dedicated server in a docker container. This dockerfile contains some extra functionality that assists with server hosting;
- **Repo overlay:** Overlay a git repo on top of your server. Useful for larger-scale server hosting.

## Notes
- Nothing is stopping you from installing another piece of server software using this. Not sure how successful it'll be, haven't tried a lot of things.
- I (mechabubba) wrote this, so your mileage may vary. First dockerfile, too!
